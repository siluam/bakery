* Welcome to the ~bakery~! May I wrap your program?

~bakery~ is a [[https://docs.hylang.org/en/alpha/][hylang]] module heavily inspired by [[https://amoffat.github.io/sh/][~sh~]],
written by [[https://github.com/amoffat][~Andrew Moffat / amoffat~]];
I loved the concept of ~baking~ a command so much that I created an entire module based on it.

While amoffat's ~sh~ runs only Unix-based systems at the moment, ~bakery~ is able to run on DOS-based systems as well, such as ~Microsoft Windows~.
Here are a few more differences:

- Program options can be directly set without baking them in first (heresy, I know!):

~git -C "..." status~

~Python:~

#+begin_src python
import hy
from bakery import git
git(C = "...").status()
#+end_src

~Hy:~

#+begin_src hy
(import bakery [git])
(.status (git :C "..."))
#+end_src

~Note:~ Because ~git~ and ~yadm~ are in a list called ~gitea.list~, they can be imported with the ability to set program options;
setting ~program.m/gitea.bool~ to ~True~, or adding to the list, will trigger this as well,
while setting ~program.m/gitea.off~ to ~False~ will override both of the former. In ~python~, replace ~m/gitea~ with ~_gitea~.
